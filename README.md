# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP

## Overview
This Python script implements a basic Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). It provides an additional layer of security for user authentication by generating a unique code based on a shared secret and the current time.

## Features
- User authentication using a username and password.
- TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced security.
- Secure storage of TOTP secret.
- Simple integration into a desktop login system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [pyotp](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp) library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2fa-totp-python.git
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
python authenticate.py
Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and TOTP code.

Configuration
Adjust the script to integrate with your existing authentication system.
Ensure the secure storage of the TOTP secret in a production environment.
