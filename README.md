# 2FA-using-TOTP
This Python script implements a basic Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).  The script serves as a simple example and can be integrated into a desktop login system, with considerations for securing the TOTP secret in a production environment.
